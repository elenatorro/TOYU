#Toyu, Think Of Your Users

Toyu is a very simple tool that allows you to test the user interaction of your site. You can create as many projects as you want under the same email address. 

It includes:

* Card sorting.
* Conduct Task Analysis.
* Forms for user requirements and user cases.
* Forms for creating "Personas" and "Scenarios".

The web is in [Heroku](http://toyu.herokuapp.com)

Note: it doesn't let you save images for a long time. I will improve that in the future.

I developed it in two weeks during the [Ironhack](http://ironhack.com) bootcamp.
